# matrix-multiplication-algorithms-runtime-comparison-python
a simple program (not super functional) for comparing the runtimes of 3 matrix multiplication algorithms (normal, strassen, divide and conquer).
after calculating the runtimes, the graphs of runtimes will be drawn into an excel file.
results may not be same on different devices.
